# README

In this project, you will design and build a quiz application. With this application, administrators can build multiple-choice quizzes. Users can take these quizzes and be scored against each other.

The application should:

Have users with registration and login
Have some users have admin abilities, allowing them to create quizzes
Quizzes have two modes: unpublished and published.
Unpublished quizzes can be edited, have questions added to them, have questions deleted from them and have questions be edited, but will not show up as a quiz to be taken.
Published quizzes cannot be edited in any way. Once published, a quiz cannot be unpublished.
Questions are multiple-choice, with one right answer.
Users can take quizzes one time. These quizzes show them one question at a time and have them answer. Show the possible answers in a random order so that the correct answer isn't in the same place every time.
After a user answers an entire quiz, show them how many they got right and record that as their score.
A user should have a dashboard where they can see their total score, their scores on individual quizzes, and a list of quizzes they can take.
If a user leaves the site mid-quiz, it is up to you what happens when they come back. Optimally, they should be in exactly the same spot on the quiz and not allowed to go to the dashboard until done.
Bonus features:

A quiz should have a leaderboard that shows the top 20 scores and players.
The site should have a leaderboard that shows the top 20 players and their total scores.
When a user is taking a quiz, show them the questions in a random order.
When a user completes a quiz, show them which ones they got right and which ones they got wrong.
Your application should be styled with CSS and use JavaScript where appropriate.

You can work in teams, with the maximum size determined by your instructor.
